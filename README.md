# graphcraft
[Demo](https://graphcraft.cruftbusters.com)

There's nothing here yet. However, this will become a tool for visualizing complex modded Minecraft crafting graphs and planning chained crafting implementations. I am playing [Nomifactory](https://github.com/Nomifactory/Nomifactory) and I spend some time translating recipes from [JEI](https://github.com/mezz/JustEnoughItems) to a text editor and keeping track of relationships between recipes in my head. I wish I had a tool to do this for me and GraphCraft should be that tool.
